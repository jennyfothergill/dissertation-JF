    Introduces epitaxial growth and how long length and time scales are needed to understand this problem
    KMC can be used to bridge the length/time scales
    Next MC can be used to randomly sample the distribution, with enough samples the thermodynamic observable should converge
    MC relies on a markov process--the step only depends on the step before, so only the transition from state_x->state_x+1 needs to be considered.
    Detail balance - the net probability flux between states is zero
    TODO could use help understanding eq 17 because it seems backwards to me?
    KMC assigns a meaning of time to the simulation steps by considering the calculated rate of the event.
    Each step can vary in the amount of time it takes.
    MorphCT uses the time-ordered list or first reaction method
    discusses parallelization--which matty implemented the way they suggest(each process is indepent for some number of events)
    They're kind of losing me in section 4... are they running kmc at the same time as MD? how?
