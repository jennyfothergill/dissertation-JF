{Miller2018}
we need a model big enough and fast enough to predict structure
order parameter
relaxation time and TPS
    these metrics were used to show that advances in hardware wouldn't give us the jump we needed and so we need better models
    still it would be cool to compare
decorrelation times
simulating solvent evaporation with slow shrinking
large volumes are needed for experimental validation

planckton removing hydrogens doesn't adjust the mass of heavy atoms

I found that in order to get agreement with Evan's results I had to change the angle cutoff to be more strict.

GRiTS
uses SMARTS matching to assign atomic indexes to coarse grain beads
bonds between cg beads are inferred based on atomistic bonding scheme
SMARTS matching is expensive so when looking at an entire simulation trajectory a simplification scheme is used
first the first frame of the trajectory is taken
this is because the perceive bond order function in openbabel relies on the atomic positions being chemically reasonable
(aromatic systems should be planar, etc)
freud clustering is used to break apart the first frame into molecules
if molecules have the same number of atoms, they are assumed to have the same chemical structure

Next steps
Evan's work showed that tie-chains are important how does the planckton workflow address the need for polydispersity
Opportunity to cite Chris' polymer builder work!
