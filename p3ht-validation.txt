GRiTS
uses SMARTS matching to assign atomic indexes to coarse grain beads
bonds between cg beads are inferred based on atomistic bonding scheme
SMARTS matching is expensive so when looking at an entire simulation trajectory a simplification scheme is used
first the first frame of the trajectory is taken
this is because the perceive bond order function in openbabel relies on the atomic positions being chemically reasonable
(aromatic systems should be planar, etc)
freud clustering is used to break apart the first frame into molecules
if molecules have the same number of atoms, they are assumed to have the same chemical structure
