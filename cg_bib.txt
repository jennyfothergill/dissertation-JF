    coarse grain model for polymers
    I'm not sure what they are getting at with the parameters in a polymer being correlated. Is what they mean that the bond length could depend on the bond angle, etc?
    studies show that the bond angle and torsion can be correlated and these correlations may matter
    bond-bond correlation : how much the vector of bond i aligns with bond i+m
    the bond-bond correlation is related to the persistence length
    "bondâˆ’bond correlation decay length, or persistence length"
    these are independent of coarse graining scale
    persistence length is related to stiffness and can help us choose the coarse graining level of a polymer
