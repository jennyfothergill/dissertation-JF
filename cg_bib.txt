    coarse grain model for polymers
    I'm not sure what they are getting at with the parameters in a polymer being correlated. Is what they mean that the bond length could depend on the bond angle, etc?
    studies show that the bond angle and torsion can be correlated and these correlations may matter
    bond-bond correlation : how much the vector of bond i aligns with bond i+m
    the bond-bond correlation is related to the persistence length
    "bondâˆ’bond correlation decay length, or persistence length"
    these are independent of coarse graining scale
    persistence length is related to stiffness and can help us choose the coarse graining level of a polymer

    Transferrable coarse graining
    CG polymer model does not capture the temp dependence of the glass transition
    sigma and epsilon of the CG model are adjusted  based on T

    however the timescales of MD and the thermomechanical experiment are mismatched

    single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have many unique properties but are difficult to synthesize in a uniform batch. post synthesis separation can use single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) which can select by chirality. but the mechanism is not understood. 
    They use gromacs and an advanced sampling method replica exchange (RE)MD
