# Intro
 - Why is what I'm doing important?
    - climate crisis 
    - TRUE
    - SWC make computational science more equitable/accessible

# Computational methods
 - containers
    - takes away cognitive load for user of having to build their own software stack
    - guarantees that user will have working code
    - helps to manage version conflicts
    - makes software more portable onto clusters, etc
 - CI pipelines/unit tests
    - proactively test whether code is working as expected
    - streamlines development
 - version control
    - allows collaboration
    - documents changes and updates
    - allows freedom to try new things without worrying about breaking anything
 - good documentation
    - a codebase without users does not serve its purpose
    - good documentation practices help users to understand how to use the code
 - notebook style examples
    - seeing code in action helps users to learn how to use it
    - code examples can be interspersed with plain text and images explaining the rationale behind why the code should work a certain way.
 - use existing libraries
    - dont reinvent the wheel
    - by using familiar libraries other developers may understand this code more easily
 - linting and style
    - by standardizing the format in which our code is written it makes it easier for users and developers to parse.
    - autolinters like pre-commit use tools like black, isort, pydocstyle, to make sure our code meets these standards
 - collaboration (mosdef)
    - gives experience working as a team
    - more people to give feedback

# Binary blend morphology sweep
 - updated planckton to...
    - use mixtures
    - load from smiles
    - use outside forcefields
    - use ele
    - use unyt for units
    - use new mbuild create hoomd sim
    - restartable sims
 - this made it easier to run a large sweep of binary donor/acceptor mixtures

# Charge transport
 - updated morphct to...
    - use pyscf
    - allow gsd file as input
    - allow SMARTs logic to be used to detect chromophores

# Coarse graining?
# Reproducibility study?
# MoSDeF?
