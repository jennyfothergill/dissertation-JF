    Review of exciton diffusion in opv polymers.

https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ct500014h 
    Exciton diffusion calculated using marcus hopping (usually used for free charges).
    Marcus theory compared to Franck-Condon (spectral overlap)
    The interactions between excitons and phonons is the reorganization energy.
    internal reorganization energy os due to the geometry changes
    external is due to lattice distortion
    external is ~1 oom smaller and is ignored in this paper (and by us?)
    good description of how to calculate reorg energy

    Review of how charges are generated in OPVs
    This paper is long
    Exciton formation through charge transfer
    read up to section 2 - gives an overview of opvs
    increasing the length of the conjugated polymer makes the opv behave in a band-like way.
    organic devices have excitons not free charges
    goes through history, first opv was single crystal polymer, the tang made first bilayer device, then the first fullerene/polymer BHJ
    talks a little about photosynthesis and how the redox relay helps by spatially separating the charges.
    this review will focus on charge transfer and photocurrent generation.
