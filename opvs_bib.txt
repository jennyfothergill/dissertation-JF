    Review of exciton diffusion in opv polymers.

https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ct500014h 
    Exciton diffusion calculated using marcus hopping (usually used for free charges).
    Marcus theory compared to Franck-Condon (spectral overlap)
    The interactions between excitons and phonons is the reorganization energy.
    internal reorganization energy os due to the geometry changes
    external is due to lattice distortion
    external is ~1 oom smaller and is ignored in this paper (and by us?)
    good description of how to calculate reorg energy
